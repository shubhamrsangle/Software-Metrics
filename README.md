# Software-Metrics
Language Independent Counting metrics and Object Oriented Metrics implemented in Python

Software Metrics to be implemented (Language Independent):

# Counting metrics:-
shubham 1. Lines Of Code (LOC)  -----------------completed 

shubham 2. McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity 

shubham 3. Comment Lines        -----------------completed 

Ayush   4. Fan-in, Fan-out

Ayush   5. Henry-Kafura Measure

Shubham 6. Number of Modules   -------------------completed

Shubham 7. Weighted Methods per Class

Ayush   8. Rejected Lines

# OO metrics:-

2. Number of children
3. Coupling and cohesion
4. Response for Class
5. Number of Public Methods
6. Data Access Metric
7. Measure of Aggregation
8. Measure of Functional Abstraction
9. Average Method Complexity
